# Project-C.O.V.I.D
Custom Operated Variable Input Dashboard


this was my 12th class project
made during Covid time hence the name
since I made it in 12th, I had poor knowedge of variable naming, therefore, the code is a mess.

This project makes full use of python to create and make changes in mysql database and create diffrent file
The user only needs to select from the option given to him and rest process is done.
This is made so the people without any knowledge of mysql can create databases.
The createion and updation of file is just an extra addon.
